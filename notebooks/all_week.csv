410,message,"OK here goes

1. Is to actually know or plan what you want to visualize or show on your dashboard. Usually, almost all the things I did for myself.
2. Next, you install stream lit or your desired mode of visualizer modules like Heroku. I prefer stream lit because I never really worked with Heroku.
3. After installing everything, you then use all your pre-written scripts here for your advantage. Meaning you can directly use all the methods and helper functions you have already written for your dashboard demonstration. Especially all your data visualization scripts.
4. Then you will create a python file or files containing the streamlit module to do the dashboard. At this point, it all comes to using the streamlit module to make and show your dashboard. You don't have to exactly show each and everything as you did in your notebook. You can make many other kinds of visualization in streamlit.
5. Finally, after you completed what you want to show using your python file or files, you then can just use the official streamlit website to host your demonstrations publicly.
Here are some reference links
1. Getting started with streamlit. <https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started>
2. Hosting apps to streamlit. <https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-cloud/get-started/deploy-an-app>

444,message,"I think the best thing to do here is to have your own schedule. Everyone has a different attitude and approach toward things. And therefore the Aluminis advice might not be applicable to some and might be even bottom line impossible for others. And therefore I would like to recommend to you based on my imperceptible wisdom to have your own schedule at the beginning of the week. Take a look at that week's challenge doc. see what we are supposed to deliver (on the deliverables section) and after you understand what we need to complete and by when you then plan out the week. Now I think the most important part about the schedule is following it, you might not complete everything on time, and you might finish some before the allotted time frame ends, But for the unfinished tasks don't waste too much unscheduled time on them, as they will definitely take up the other tasks time. So by planning and following your schedule even if you don't complete everything you might manage to get lots done.

Last but not least, don't forget other areas of your life in the meantime. Everyday balance is very necessary and is definitely, at least for me, what constitutes the good life.

• firstly, all of the provided documents are good but does not help very much when it comes to tasks, it kind off building general intuition about a topic.
• secondly, what I assume it will fit my needs is ,  same week project doc with attached  links or key words to guide us in our searching for each task separately. for example, could be a figure under each task listing links and helpful key words.
• Thirdly, in tutorials, it be very helpful if the tutors explained which functions we will be using in our week project , and linking directly where we will use the tool or the topic he is explaining right now in the project or tasks. and this maybe for the first few weeks when we are trying to familiarize ourselves with flow of work and calm down the stress

so one way to log your DVC version would be if your data is tagged with v1 you would create a dictionary
`params = {`
   `""dvc_data_ver"": ""v1""`
`}`
``` mlflow.log_params(params)```
you can also use log_param to log a single key:value pair

648,message,"I definitely caused some confusion so to clear things up --

From a fresh setup, you start off with these commands by initializing a git and a DVC repository
```git init
dvc init
git commit -m ""initial commit""```
You then follow on to set the DVC remote -- this is the MOST crucial step and should be done first because messing with different remotes and then tracking the changes on multiple unsynchronized remotes will lead to unnecessary complications as we saw.
```dvc remote add -d myremote <gdrive://folderid>
git commit -m ""sets dvc remote""```
the remote URL can be in your local file system but using google drive will be really helpful for collaboration as you are working in teams. Please follow this <https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/setup-google-drive-remote|link> to learn more.

After this will follow the steps where you will actually track the data.
```dvc add path_to_data
git add path_to_data.dvc
git commit -m ""data:track""```
You then tag the specific commit and then push it to your DVC remote using `dvc push`
```git tag -a 'v1' -m ""raw data""
dvc push```
The final two steps are the only steps that are necessary and the steps you'll iterate over and over once DVC and your DVC remote are set and you start making changes to your data.",Mandy Sweeney,1662073315.332009,text,1662073315.332009,2,2,"U03U1FNPEUX,U03UJN29Y4C",1662477316.800639,2
649,message,"So if you've changed your remote and then are trying to go back and get a tagged version of your data using dvc.api.get_url that will lead to the data URL being in a previous remote. If you have set multiple remotes and are sure the data is there try adding the remote argument.
`data_url = dvc.api.get_url(`
    `path = path,`

maybe the resources are here but no guide lines to see where to read.

I feel that filling those 2 columns with previous tsa filling methods is logical

`Promo2SinceWeek`

`PromoInterva`

Hello, I am starting study group, and I will be pleased by joining me with this mission to moon and back
Looking for dreamers, tomorrow thinkers, and Lazy people who find innovative ways to solve problems
Initial thoughts of how we will work:
• do first group meeting to get familiar with the context and assign tasks 
• we will divide the reading materials based on our number 
• every assign group of two or one person will discuss their reading materials and come up with questions.
• we will run group meeting tomorrow for about hour and give every person (group) time to explain his assigned reading material for the rest of the group  
• we will use QFT for discussion
• Then every one go and read the other materials
Who is eager to join us, Let us do the job together

1. Read up extensively on LLP
2.   Set up dvc and cml
3.   jupyter notebooks: EDA on the datasets
4.   Python: Prompts engineering using API (still not sure how to fine tune with this yet)
5.  fastapi or flask API endpoint (I don't know how to go about this or even if it's step 5)

1417,message,"I think you are right....
1. Read and research on prompt engineering and its algorithms
    a. understand transformer algorithm
    b. understand basics of GPT
2. Then, I believe the next step after setting up your repo is EDA on the given datasets and customizing the data to get better performances(results) from the co:here api.
    a. you will be working on creating the best input data out of the given dataset
    b. you consume the co:here API (simply send you prepared data to the api and you receive predictions from the model)
    c. Finally you put all these steps together by creating your own API
    d. your API should have two end-point ( i think they behave more or less the same): one endpoint for the news scoring and the other endpoint for extracting entities from job description
        i. So here is what you will do: your api should accept dataset(in json format possibly) then you transform, clean, feature engineer, the received data through your pipeline then send the prepared data to the co:here API, (notice there are two APIs involving in this project)....then you present the results via UI
Your API accept data-&gt;you transform data through pipeline-&gt;send prepared data to co:here-&gt; receive predictions -&gt; return the results to the user via UI
That is wha I understood from the guidelines....(please, remind me if I miss anything)",Judith Bolton,1663146836.986529,text,1663145914.649449,0,0,0,0,4
1418,message,"Also, the best thing I think you can add to this is the schedule and planning part. If you have for example 20 tasks to do it will be very beneficial for you to plan what to do and when to do it. That way you will reduce overthinking and overcommitting on a single specific task. Instead, you will try to do all the tasks, instead of overcommitting on a single topic or task that might be a blocker for you. I do not practice what I just preached, but I am trying to do that in order to have the max out of myself and my time.

Try to use a distributed system if you want to go for DB instead of using a non-distributed system which could be a single-point of failure and you should be able to show how secure it is because NFT management needs to be very secure.

And your application should communicate with your kafka cluster. Then apply spark to transform and load your audio data from the kafka cluster.

This week challenge will be in groups. If you went through the document earlier today you might have missed the group section as they were created today for ease in sharing AWS resources. Kindly confirm your group members, ensure that you're in touch before the end of today (creating private channels), start organizing meetings and let's do this.

Semantic Segmentation
Semantic Segmentation is the task of segmenting parts of an image that belong to the same class. Semantic Segmentation models make predictions for each pixel and return the probabilities of the classes for each pixel. These models are evaluated on Mean Intersection Over Union (Mean IoU).

Instance Segmentation
Instance Segmentation is the variant of Image Segmentation where every distinct object is segmented, instead of one segment per class.

Panoptic Segmentation
Panoptic Segmentation is the Image Segmentation task that segments the image both by instance and by class, assigning each pixel a different instance of the class.",Travis Butler,1667239495.049429,text,0,0,0,0,0,11

As such we have three channels: <#C049REFEVB9|all-ml-week12>, <#C049RETDA31|all-de-week12>, and <#C04AJMGPU01|all-web3-week12>. Everyone has been added to the respective channel and each channel has all tutors added as well.

Use these channels to ask questions and drive conversations as most of you have actually chosen similar projects and concepts within the same track are very similar.",Michele Sparks,1668002190.911759,text,0,0,0,0,0,12
